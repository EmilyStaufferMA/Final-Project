## Description
Takes a bunch of photos, scans or finds an empty spot in the photo that is atlest x big, and puts a water mark on it. It should then
be outputted to a folder that will be named with whatever the user inputs it to be, all the photos should keep their original name 
but have WM (watermark) attached to it. This will be very useful for an artist who has a lot tof works and doesn't want to go in 
and water mark each individually and then rename than with a WM (watermark) indicator. This will save time.

## Features
- Feature 1
  - Finding an empty spot in the image to place a watermark, but also has a default in the bottom left corner just incase it can't
  - find an empty spot.
- Feature 2
  - Ouputting it to a folder with the a custom name from the person running the program.
- Feature 3
  - Tagging  all the images name with a WM possibly inputted by the user.

## Challenges
- How to get the computer to look at an image, determine where there is an open spot, and feed that back to the program so it can
- put a watermark there. Also have a backup location incase the program can't find an empty spot. It's technically only one challenge but I am confident this will be the hardest part.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- program outputs watermarks in correct spots, tagged names, and possibly even be able to change the watermark

Minimal Outcome:
- Ideally atleast get the program to output a large amount of pictures with water marks and tagged names.

## Milestones
- Week 1
  1. Get the program to take in images and output them into a custom named folder.
  2. Images are tagged with WM.
- Week 1
  1. Get the computer to find an empty space for the watermark.
  2. Set up a default for the water mark and test to make sure that atleast works.
- Week 1
  1. Work on getting the watermark working with the "finder" part of the program.
  2. Work on ways for user to imput custom watermarks.
